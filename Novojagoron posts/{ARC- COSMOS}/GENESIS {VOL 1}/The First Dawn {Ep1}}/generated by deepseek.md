**Slide 1 — TITLE**  
THE FIRST DAWN  
A story from nothingness to light.  
_(Visual: Pure darkness giving way to the faintest first light.)_

**Slide 2 — THE START OF EVERYTHING**  
TIME ZERO  
~13.8 billion years ago: the Big Bang. The sudden emergence of space, time, and all energy, beginning as an unimaginably hot, dense point and expanding.  
_(Visual: A simple, elegant depiction of expansion.)_

**Slide 3 — THE PRIMORDIAL INFERNO** _(INFO-HEAVY)_  
A SEA OF ENERGY  
The first moments: a soup of fundamental particles and intense radiation.  
Temperatures exceeding a trillion degrees.  
No atoms, no structure—only the pure forces of physics in control.

**Slide 4 — MATTER COALESCES**  
FROM QUARKS TO BUILDING BLOCKS  
As the cosmos cooled:  
• Quarks combined to form protons and neutrons.  
• A cosmic tipping of the scales: matter barely outlasted antimatter.  
This fragile surplus is why anything exists at all.

**Slide 5 — THE UNIVERSE'S FIRST ALCHEMY** _(INFO-HEAVY)_  
BIRTH OF THE ELEMENTS  
Within the first 3–20 minutes:  
• Hydrogen (~75%)  
• Helium (~25%)  
• A whisper of lithium  
The recipe for everything to come was set, but nothing heavier could yet be forged.

**Slide 6 — THE COSMIC LIGHTSWITCH**  
THE UNIVERSE CLEARS  
~380,000 years later:  
• Electrons join nuclei, forming the first atoms.  
• Light, previously trapped, is finally set free.  
This released glow is the Cosmic Microwave Background—our oldest cosmic photograph.

**Slide 7 — THE DARK AGES**  
SILENCE AND SHADOW  
For millions of years:  
• Neutral hydrogen fog fills the cosmos.  
• No stars, no galaxies.  
The universe, now transparent, expands in profound darkness.

**Slide 8 — THE SEEDS OF STRUCTURE**  
GRAVITY STARTS TO SCULPT  
Tiny ripples in density, left from the beginning, begin to grow.  
Invisible dark matter forms vast, gravitational scaffolds—the hidden framework for all future structure.

**Slide 9 — THE GATHERING OF GAS**  
FUEL FOR CREATION  
Primordial gas is pulled by gravity into the wells of dark matter.  
It compresses, it heats—reaching a point of no return. The stage is set for ignition.

**Slide 10 — THE FIRST GENERATION OF STARS** _(INFO-HEAVY)_  
POPULATION III  
• Made only from pristine hydrogen and helium (zero "metals").  
• Monstrous in size, from 10 to 300 times the mass of our Sun.  
• Fiercely hot and blindingly bright.  
(We know them from simulations; they remain just beyond our direct sight.)

**Slide 11 — WHY THEY WERE GIANTS**  
THE FRAGMENTATION PROBLEM  
With no heavy elements to help cool it, the primordial gas couldn't splinter easily. It collapsed into fewer, but vastly larger, stellar behemoths.

**Slide 12 — IGNITION**  
THE FIRST DAWN ARRIVES  
In the core of a Population III star, nuclear fusion sparks.  
For the first time since its infancy, the universe creates its own light. This is the moment of the First Dawn.

**Slide 13 — REIONIZATION: LIGHT'S SECOND ACT** _(INFO-HEAVY)_  
RESHAPING THE COSMOS  
The fierce ultraviolet light from the first stars and galaxies:  
• Tore electrons from neutral hydrogen atoms.  
• Burned away the cosmic fog.  
• Made the universe transparent again, ending the Dark Ages.

**Slide 14 — BRIEF, GLORIOUS LIVES**  
A FAST BURN  
Their immense size was a trade-off:  
• Lifespans of only a few million years.  
• Rapid, furious fuel consumption.  
• Destined for cataclysmic ends.

**Slide 15 — THE FIRST COSMIC FORGES**  
SUPERNOVA AWAKENING  
Their spectacular deaths became cosmic foundries.  
In the blast, they forged and scattered the first heavy elements—carbon, oxygen, silicon—seeding the universe with complexity.

**Slide 16 — A NEW COSMIC ERA**  
FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX  
• New elements allowed gas to cool and fragment efficiently.  
• Smaller, longer-lived stars (Population II) could now form.  
• The chaotic first steps gave way to more stable galaxies.

**Slide 17 — THE FIRST BLACK HOLES**  
SEEDS OF THE ABYSS  
The most massive stars may have collapsed directly into black holes.  
These could have been the seeds for the supermassive black holes that power early quasars.

**Slide 18 — GALAXIES ARE BORN**  
ISLANDS OF LIGHT  
Stars gathered, drawn together by gravity, into the first galaxies.  
These were turbulent, dense, and brilliant nurseries, far more active than their modern descendants.

**Slide 19 — WHY IT MATTERS**  
OUR ORIGIN STORY  
The First Dawn:  
• Lit the cosmic darkness.  
• Created the elements for planets and life.  
• Built the foundations for all structure.  
It was the universe waking up and becoming complex.

**Slide 20 — CONCLUSION**  
THE FIRST DAWN  
• It began in a flash of existence.  
• It endured an era of darkness.  
• It ignited with the first stars.  
• It built the foundation for everything we know.  
All light traces its lineage back to this dawn.
