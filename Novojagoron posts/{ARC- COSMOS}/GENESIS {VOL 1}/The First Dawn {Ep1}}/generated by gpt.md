## Slide 1 — TITLE / OPENING

**THE FIRST DAWN**  
_From origin to illumination._  
(Visual: deep black fading into a faint glow)

---

## Slide 2 — THE BEGINNING

**Time zero**  
~13.8 billion years ago, space, time, energy, and matter emerged in the Big Bang — the universe began hot, dense, and expanding.  
(Visual: minimalist expansion graphic)

---

## Slide 3 — THE EARLY FIREBALL (INFO-HEAVY)

**A universe of energy**  
• First seconds: quarks, leptons, radiation  
• Temperatures >10¹² K  
• No atoms, no structure  
Physics ruled by fundamental forces.  
(Reference: standard Big Bang cosmology)

---

## Slide 4 — PARTICLES TO PROTONS

**Matter takes form**  
As the universe cooled:  
• Quarks bound into protons and neutrons  
• Matter–antimatter annihilation left a small excess of matter  
This imbalance made existence possible.  
(Visual: particle → nucleon transition)

---

## Slide 5 — BIG BANG NUCLEOSYNTHESIS (INFO-HEAVY)

**The first elements**  
~3–20 minutes after the Big Bang:  
• Hydrogen (~75%)  
• Helium (~25%)  
• Trace lithium  
No heavier elements could form yet.  
(Observed abundances confirm this phase.)

---

## Slide 6 — LIGHT BREAKS FREE

**The universe becomes transparent**  
~380,000 years later:  
• Electrons bind to nuclei → atoms form  
• Photons decouple from matter  
• Cosmic Microwave Background released  
(Visual: smooth CMB map)

---

## Slide 7 — THE COSMIC DARK AGES

**Light without sources**  
• Time: ~380,000 to ~100 million years  
• Neutral hydrogen fills space  
• No stars, no galaxies  
The universe expands in near-total darkness.  
(Visual: vast black cosmic field)

---

## Slide 8 — STRUCTURE EMERGES

**Gravity organizes matter**  
Tiny density fluctuations grow.  
Dark matter halos form — invisible scaffolding for future stars and galaxies.  
(Visual: filamentary cosmic web)

---

## Slide 9 — GAS FALLS IN

**The first collapse**  
Hydrogen and helium fall into dark matter wells, heating and compressing until star formation becomes inevitable.  
(Gravity sets the stage.)  
(Visual: gas streams into halo)

---

## Slide 10 — THE FIRST STARS (INFO-HEAVY)

**Population III**  
• First-generation stars  
• Zero metals (pristine gas)  
• Masses ~10–300× Sun  
• Extremely hot and luminous  
(Inferred from simulations, not yet directly observed)

---

## Slide 11 — WHY THEY WERE GIANTS

**Cooling limits shape destiny**  
Without heavy elements, gas cooled inefficiently — forming fewer, much larger stars than seen today.  
(Metallicity controls fragmentation.)  
(Visual: modern vs primordial cloud comparison)

---

## Slide 12 — THE FIRST LIGHT

**Ignition**  
Nuclear fusion ignited in Population III cores.  
For the first time since recombination, the universe produced its own starlight.  
This moment defines the **First Dawn**.  
(Visual: star igniting in darkness)

---

## Slide 13 — REIONIZATION (INFO-HEAVY)

**Light reshapes space**  
• Intense UV radiation ionized neutral hydrogen  
• Ended the Dark Ages  
• Increased cosmic transparency  
(Confirmed by quasar absorption spectra)

---

## Slide 14 — SHORT, VIOLENT LIVES

**Brilliance without patience**  
• Lifetimes: ~2–5 million years  
• Rapid fuel consumption  
• Ended as supernovae or direct collapse black holes  
(Mass determined fate.)  
(Visual: compressed life-cycle arc)

---

## Slide 15 — FIRST SUPERNOVAE

**Chemical awakening**  
Explosions forged and dispersed the first heavy elements — carbon, oxygen, silicon.  
The universe gained complexity.  
(Visual: expanding elemental shockwave)

---

## Slide 16 — COSMIC TRANSFORMATION

**From simple to complex**  
• Metals enable efficient cooling  
• Smaller stars can now form  
• Stable galaxies emerge  
Transition: Population III → Population II stars.

---

## Slide 17 — FIRST BLACK HOLES

**Seeds of the extreme**  
Some massive stars collapsed directly into black holes, possibly seeding the supermassive black holes seen in early galaxies.  
(Linked to high-redshift quasars)

---

## Slide 18 — GALAXIES IGNITE

**Systems of light**  
Stars cluster into the first galaxies — compact, chaotic, and intensely active compared to modern ones.  
(Visual: early galaxy simulation)

---

## Slide 19 — WHY THE FIRST DAWN MATTERS

**Everything traces back here**  
• Ended cosmic darkness  
• Created heavy elements  
• Enabled galaxies, planets, chemistry, life  
This was the universe becoming structured.

---

## Slide 20 — KEY TAKEAWAYS / CLOSING

**THE FIRST DAWN**  
• Began with the Big Bang  
• Passed through darkness  
• Ignited with the first stars  
• Built the foundation of complexity  
_Every light we see began here._
