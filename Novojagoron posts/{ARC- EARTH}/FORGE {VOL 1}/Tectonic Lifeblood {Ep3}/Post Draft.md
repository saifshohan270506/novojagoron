**Slide 1 — TITLE / HOOK (Dynamic)**
**TECTONIC LIFEBLOOD**
The ground beneath your feet is not still. It is adrift on a sea of fire, part of a slow, global dance of colliding continents, birthing oceans, and rising mountains. This is the heartbeat of a living planet.
*(Visual: A striking time-lapse animation of the last 250 million years of continental drift, from Pangaea to today.)*

**Slide 2 — THE RESTLESS SKIN**
Earth's outer shell is broken into giant, interlocking pieces called **tectonic plates**. These plates of rigid **lithosphere** (crust + upper mantle) float and move atop the hot, soft, ductile **asthenosphere**. The engine is the heat from the deep Earth.
*(Visual: An animated cross-section diagram showing lithospheric plates moving over the convecting, glowing asthenosphere.)*

**Slide 3 — THE GLOBAL JIGSAW**
About 15 major plates and dozens of smaller ones form a planetary puzzle. Their boundaries are where the action happens: where they pull apart, collide, or slide past one another. This map is the key to Earth's geology.

**Slide 4 — WHERE PLATES DIVIDE: Divergent Boundaries**
Plates pull apart. Magma from the mantle rises to fill the gap, creating **new crust**. On land, this forms **continental rift valleys** (like East Africa). Under the sea, it creates **mid-ocean ridges**—the longest mountain ranges on Earth.
*(Visual: An animated cross-section of a mid-ocean ridge: plates separating, magma rising and solidifying into new oceanic crust.)*

**Slide 5 — BIRTH OF AN OCEAN: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge**
The **Mid-Atlantic Ridge** snakes down the center of the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the Eurasian and North American plates are moving apart at ~2.5 cm/year, pushing the continents farther apart and widening the Atlantic.

**Slide 6 — WHERE PLATES COLLIDE: Convergent Boundaries (Subduction)**
When an oceanic plate meets a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate dives beneath in a **subduction zone**. This creates deep ocean **trenches** and melts rock, fueling chains of violent volcanoes on the overriding continent.
*(Visual: An animated cross-section of an oceanic plate subducting under a continent, generating a trench and a volcanic arc.)*

**Slide 7 — THE RING OF FIRE**
The **Pacific Ring of Fire** is a horseshoe-shaped belt around the Pacific Ocean defined by subduction zones. It is home to **75% of the world's volcanoes** and **90% of its earthquakes**. This is the most geologically active region on the planet.

**Slide 8 — WHERE CONTINENTS COLLIDE**
When two continental plates meet, neither can subduct easily. Instead, they crumple and thicken in a monumental slow-motion crash, thrusting up the world's highest mountains. The Himalayas are rising as India rams into Eurasia.
*(Visual: An animated cross-section of two continental plates colliding, with crust folding and thrusting upward into mountains.)*

**Slide 9 — WHERE PLATES SLIDE: Transform Boundaries**
Plates can also slide horizontally past each other at **transform boundaries**. Friction locks them until stress builds and releases in sudden, powerful **earthquakes**. The San Andreas Fault in California is a famous example.
*(Visual: A diagram of a transform fault, showing plates grinding past each other and releasing seismic energy as an earthquake.)*

**Slide 10 — THE SMOKING GUN: Paleomagnetic Stripes**
The clinching proof of plate tectonics is on the seafloor. As magma cools at mid-ocean ridges, it records Earth's magnetic field. The result: symmetric "stripes" of normal and reversed magnetism on either side of the ridge—a tape recording of seafloor spreading.
*(Visual: A clear diagram of the symmetric magnetic stripes (black/white) parallel to a mid-ocean ridge axis.)*

**Slide 11 — THE GREAT RECYCLER**
The entire system is a giant conveyor belt. **New crust** is born at ridges. **Old crust** is consumed in trenches. The entire ocean floor is recycled every **~200 million years**. Earth's surface is in a constant state of renewal.
*(Visual: A global animated loop showing crust generation at ridges, movement, and destruction at subduction zones.)*

**Slide 12 — THE PULSE OF THE PLANET**
Plot the world's earthquakes and volcanoes. They form perfect lines tracing the edges of the tectonic plates. This seismic and volcanic activity is the real-time pulse of the tectonic engine.
*(Visual: A global map with recent earthquake epicenters (dots) and volcano locations (triangles) overlaid perfectly on plate boundaries.)*

**Slide 13 — THE SUPERCONTINENT CYCLE**
On a billion-year scale, continents merge and break apart in a **supercontinent cycle**. Pangaea was the last, 335-175 million years ago. The next, "Amasia," may form in 250 million years. This is the long rhythm of the tectonic heartbeat.
*(Visual: A series of four maps showing: Pangaea → Present Day → A future supercontinent prediction.)*

**Slide 14 — WHY IT MATTERS: The Habitability Engine**
Plate tectonics is not just geology—it is Earth's **life-support system**:
*   **Recycles Carbon** (regulates climate).
*   **Builds Continents** (land for life).
*   **Forms Ore Deposits** (metals for technology).
*   **Drives the Rock Cycle** (renews nutrients).
A planet without tectonics is a planet that stagnates.

**Slide 15 — THE STONE ARCHIVE (Tease Next Episode)**
This dynamic skin is made of rock—the ultimate archive. Locked within its layers is the entire history of Earth: ancient climates, extinct lifeforms, and the story of our planet's transformation.
*(Visual: A close-up of stratified rock layers, like the Grand Canyon.)

**Ready for the next episode.** These slides detail the grand unifying theory of geology. The corresponding **Website Blog Post Expansion** would delve into the history of Alfred Wegener and Harry Hess, the physics of slab pull and ridge push, the evidence from ophiolites and paleomagnetism, and the deep connection between tectonics and the planetary carbon cycle.
